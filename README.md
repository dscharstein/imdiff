# imdiff

A program for visualizing stereo matching costs

## User Information

### About

This tool provides a visualization of pixel-wise matching costs between two images, for use in stereo vision research. The user can apply transformations to one of the two images in order to line up corresponding objects in the scene. The tool performs best on a rectified stereo pair. It is a native application written in c++ using OpenCV. 

The user can select between several methods of computing the matching cost between two images: 
`color difference`
`ICPR`
`NCC`

#### Command Line

To run the application from the command line:

usage: ./imdiff im1 im2 [planes=, gt=, occmask=, decimate=, offx=, offy=]

Note: The command line parser does not expect spaces before/after the equals signs. 

#### Dependencies

This program makes use of a pfm reader, which is part of the distribution.
The pfm reader can also be downloaded separately from github via

`git clone https://github.com/dscharstein/pfmLib.git`
